## Overview

_**Wat'd Ya Eat?** is an online food journal. In this day and age where just about everything has loads of sugar and carbs, it's hard to eat healthy, but recording your food intake is a step in the right direction. 


<br>

## MVP
_The **Wat'd Ya Eat?** MVP is a full stack CRUD application. The user can create an account and log in each day to record your daily meals, edit or delete incorrect logs. The user can look back on previous weeks to see how their diets have changed over time. 

<br>

## Issues

I expect the most trouble with the login authentication system and the create and edit logic on the backend. I also expect some road blocks when transfering information back up from the react components, into the database or vice versa. These are problems that were encountered during project 3.

<br>

### Goals

- _Monday: Create and seed sample data, create routes, models and controllers, make sure data renders on page.
- _Tuesday: Create login page and authentication token system. Make sure user can create account and update database.
- _Wednesday: Create frontend react app. Make sure data can pass between front and back end of application.
- _Thursday: Make sure user can create an account, login. And make sure basic CRUD works.
- _Friday: Styling day, including media queries.
